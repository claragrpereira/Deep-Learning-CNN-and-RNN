# Homework 2 - Skeleton Code

This project was a part of a machine learning course.
This archive contains the following files:

## statement.pdf

The statement for the project, contains details about the CNN and RNN's architecture.

## download_octmnist.py

Allows you to download the OCTMNIST dataset to a compressed `.npz` file, which `hw2-q2.py` can load.

## utils.py

Utility functions for `hw2-q2.py`

## hw2-q2.py

Contains code for Question 2, which covers image classification using CNNs, with implementation in torch.

## hw2-q3.ipynb

Contains code for Question 3, which covers a sequence-to-sequence task using RNNs and attention, with implementation in torch. Using *google colab* or *kaggle* to run the notebook with GPU accelerators is advised.
